# Project 1 - *Lord Shadow's Story*

Submitted by: **TaeVon Lewis**

**Lord Shadow's Story** is an app that introduces Cid Kagenou and his squad Shadow Garden from the anime The Eminence in Shadow.

Time spent: **About 1** hour spent in total outside of the README's gif issue.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are able to see a customized app icon and launch screen
- [x] Your app should work for any screen size and orientation using AutoLayout constraints
- [x] Users are able to see at least 3 context items
- [x] Users are able to tap into each context item and see detail view contains information about each item (title, description, picture if applicable, etc.)
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [ ] Allow users to scroll when context items are off-screen (table view implemention)

## Notes

Although the user interface design tool provided by the Storyboard may lack some intuitiveness, I did not have a hard time using it for the project's implementation.
