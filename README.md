# Intermediate iOS Development Spring 2023 (iOS102)
This repository encompasses all the projects I have completed during the Intermediate iOS Development bootcamp offered by Codepath. 

Each project features two distinct branches, namely [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/), with each branch containing the same project implemented using its respective framework.

### [My Story](mystory)<a name="MyStory"></a>

My Story is a iOS app created using only Storyboard. The app is a profile page about a fictional character, Cid Kagenou, from the anime The Eminence in the Shadow. The app features high-level context items on its initial screen, which the user can tap on to reveal more information about Cid Kagenou.

Additonal Details:
- The app implements AutoLayout and ensures that the content is properly laid out and fits on the screen in both portrait and landscape orientations. Data is passed between the different view controllers to provide a smooth user experience.

- Additionally, the app includes a customized app icon and launch screen. The launch screen displays the Profile view, providing a seamless experience for the user.
