# Codepath - Intermediate iOS Development Spring 2023 (iOS102)
This repository showcases my proficiency in iOS Development, as demonstrated through the completion of projects from Codepath's Intermediate iOS Development bootcamp.

## Codepath
This Codepath course is a free, 10-Week intermediate level iOS Development bootcamp that offers a project-based exploration of mobile app development, with a focus on the design and implementation of RESTful API clients. Throughout the course, students strengthen their technical skills by completing coding labs and building fully functioning apps using APIs and Apple SDKs.

The course covers various topics, including View and View Controllers, Auto Layout, Navigation, Animation and Gestures, Debugging, XCode, REST APIs, and CRUD (Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting) online data. During the second half of the course, students participate in a group project and apply everything they've learned into conceptualizing, designing, and architecting their own functioning mobile apps from scratch. At the end of the course, each team presents their app at CodePath's Demo Day and receives valuable feedback from seasoned software engineers. 

##
Each project features two distinct branches, namely [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/), with each branch containing the same project implemented using its respective framework.

The projects have been listed chronologically, with the <strong>latest project being displayed first</strong>.

### [My Story](My-Story)<a name="MyStory"></a>

My Story is a iOS app created using only Storyboard. The app is a profile page about a fictional character, Cid Kagenou, from the anime The Eminence in the Shadow. The app features high-level context items on its initial screen, which the user can tap on to reveal more information about Cid Kagenou.

Additonal Details:
- The app implements AutoLayout and ensures that the content is properly laid out and fits on the screen in both portrait and landscape orientations. Data is passed between the different view controllers to provide a smooth user experience.

- Additionally, the app includes a customized app icon and launch screen. The launch screen displays the Profile view, providing a seamless experience for the user.
